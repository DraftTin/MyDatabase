## Contribution Highlights
This project was focusing on designing and implementing a relational database engine from scratch. Key contributions to the project include:

### Core Contributions:
- **Database Architecture and Design:**
  - Played an integral role in defining the overall architecture and modular design of the database engine.
  - Ensured the design adhered to principles of scalability, maintainability, and performance optimization.

- **Memory and Disk Management:**
  - Implemented an efficient buffer management system for caching frequently accessed pages.
  - Designed file handling and disk storage mechanisms to optimize data retrieval and persistence.

- **Indexing with B+ Trees:**
  - Developed a B+ tree-based indexing mechanism to enable fast and efficient query processing.
  - Integrated indexing with storage management to handle large datasets and ensure consistency.

- **SQL-Like Statement Support:**
  - Designed and implemented support for SQL-like DDL (e.g., table creation) and DML (e.g., insert, delete, update) statements.
  - Created a parser to translate user commands into low-level database operations.

### Testing and Debugging:
- **Unit and Integration Tests:**
  - Designed and executed a suite of tests covering core functionalities, including concurrency, indexing, and file handling.
  - Identified and resolved edge cases to ensure robust and error-free database operations.

### Concurrency Support:
- Implemented thread-safe operations using reader-writer locks for concurrent data access, ensuring database reliability in multi-threaded environments.

### Development Practices:
- Utilized CMake for cross-platform builds and organized modular components for efficient collaboration.
- Followed coding standards and documentation practices to enhance code readability and maintainability.

This database serves as a foundation for further exploration of database systems and algorithms, showcasing a comprehensive understanding of relational database design.
